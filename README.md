# Predicting House Prices: Regression Analysis 

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for building a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key property features such as area, bedrooms, and location.  

It was developed as part of a **data science work sample** by **Shubham Agarwal**, showcasing practical skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and performance visualization.

## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To train and evaluate a regression model that predicts housing prices using structured property data.

**Key Steps:**
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Handle missing values and fix data issues.
3. Select features (`X`) and target variable (`y`).
4. Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Train a Linear Regression model using `scikit-learn`.
6. Evaluate model performance using R² and RMSE.
7. Visualize predictions and residuals.
8. Discuss findings and limitations.
